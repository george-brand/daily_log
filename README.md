# daily_log
daily_log is a django-based app that a user can use to create log topics and make log entries.  I created this app by following the example in the book
Python Crash Course.  I created this app for two main reasons.  First, it will help me improve my skills for python, django, git and vs code.  Second, it
will motivate me to work on areas where I have created a topic.  Topics that I plan to create include: exercise, python development, web development and continuing
professional development (CPD) hours for my professional engineering (PE) license.

For the initial commits, I included the django settings.py file in the .gitignore file until I figure out how to handle the SECRET_KEY so I don't make it public.
Maybe this doesn't matter since I'll probably be the only one using the daily_log app - even if I deploy it to Heroku or some other platform.  I just need to 
understand the security settings (including DEBUG = FALSE) a little better.
