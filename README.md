# daily_log
daily_log is a django-based app that a user can use to create log topics and make log entries.  I created this app by following the example in the book
Python Crash Course.  I wanted to create this app for two main reasons.  First, it will help me improve my skills for python, <code>django</code>, git and vs code.  Second, it
will motivate me to work on areas where I have created a topic.  Topics that I plan to create include: Exercise, Python Development, Web Development and Continuing
Professional Development (CPD) Courses for my professional engineering (PE) license.  If I have a daily_log app up and running, that should help motivate me to work on one or more of my topics when I have time.  

For the initial commits, I included the django settings.py file in the .gitignore file until I figure out how to handle the SECRET_KEY so I don't make it public.
Maybe this doesn't matter since I'll probably be the only one using the daily_log app - even if I deploy it to Heroku or some other platform.  I just need to 
understand the security settings (including DEBUG = FALSE) a little better.
